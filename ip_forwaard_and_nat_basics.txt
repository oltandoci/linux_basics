Host-A needs to send an IP packet to Host B.
The network is composed by 4 devices:

Host-A <---------> Router-A <---------> Router-B <---------> Host-B
       eth0   eth0          eth1   eth0          eth1   eth0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Host A
IP = 1.1.1.10

Local config:
ip route add default via 1.1.1.1

Host-A sends the original IP packet in an Ethernet frame to Router-A.
The destination MAC address of the frame is the MAC address of Router-A, 
which ensures that Router-A receives the IP packet contained within for routing.
he destination IP address, however, is not that of Router-A; it's that of Host-B, 
the true eventual destination of the packet 
(in other words, the IP addresses in the packet are not modified).
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Router A
Gateway 1 (eth0) IP = 1.1.1.1
Gateway 2 (eth1) IP = 2.2.2.1

Local config (all commands are the same):
echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
To save the forwarding permanently, do:
open /etc/rc.d/rc.local and insert the line:
echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

Router-A receives the Ethernet frame and the data plane operations begin. 
For Router-A to forward the packet on to the appropriate next hop, 
it must know who the next hop is and the MAC address of the next hop. 
To determine the next hop, the router inspects the destination IP address of the IP packet 
(IP routing is always based upon the destination IP address). 
Router-A references the local route table for an entry that matches 
the destination IP address (3.3.3.10) and finds that 3.3.3.0/24 
is reachable via a next hop IP address of 2.2.2.2 (Router-B).
The source MAC address is also rewritten to the MAC address of the eth1 
interface on Router-A so that Router-B knows it received the frame from Router-A. 
It is this process of rewriting the frame MAC addresses that represents 
the key concept of data plane operationsâ€”A router does not modify 
the source or destination IP addresses of IP packets that are being delivered, 
but rather it must rewrite the destination and source MAC address 
so that the IP packet can be delivered over the LAN to the next hop.
The rewritten Ethernet frame containing the IP packet is sent to Router-B.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Router B
Gateway 1 (eth0) IP = 2.2.2.2
Gateway 2 (eth1) IP = 3.3.3.1

Local config (all commands are the same):
echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

Router-B receives the frame from Router-A and examines the 
destination IP address of the packet. 
Because the destination IP address is that of a host that is locally connected, 
Router-B can complete the delivery by sending the packet to Host-B. 
Because Host-B is connected via Ethernet to Router-B, 
Router-B must send the IP packet inside an Ethernet frame addressed to Host-B. 
The same rewrite of the destination (and source) MAC address that 
was described above takes place, 
and the frame is delivered to its final destination, Host-B.

Host B
IP = 3.3.3.10

Local config:
ip route add default via 3.3.3.1
